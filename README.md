## Challenges

As part of my coursework, I completed several challenges to strengthen my web development skills. Here are some highlights:

### Challenge 5-1: Center an Image and Apply CSS Filters
- Created a webpage that centred an image, applied CSS filters for colour effects, and added rounded edges using the `border-radius` property.

### Challenge 5-2: Create a Footer with CSS
- Implemented a centred and styled footer with bold text using the `text-align` and `font-weight` properties.

### Challenge 5-3: Create a Styled Table
- Developed a table with customized borders, padding, and background colour using CSS. Added background colour to the table header and padding within the cells for readability.

### Challenge 5-8: Image Overlay Fade Effect
- Applied CSS transitions to create a smooth image overlay fade effect, allowing text to display over an image when hovered.

### Challenge 5-9: Embed a Video with Autoplay
- Embedded a short video clip that auto-plays, is muted, and loops infinitely when loaded on the webpage. This demonstrated my ability to handle multimedia content with HTML5.
